## WT32-ETH01 MQTT Client Node Setup
This repository provides a basic setup for an MQTT client node designed to communicate over TCP using the WT32-ETH01 module.

## Entering Programming Mode on the WT32-ETH01
Putting the WT32-ETH01 into programming mode can be a little tricky the first time, but once you've done it, it's straightforward.

## Required Hardware
You will need a TTL device programmer. For this project, I am using the Waveshare USB to RS232 / RS485 / TTL converter.

## Wiring the WT32-ETH01 for Programming
Power: Connect 5V from your power supply or programmer to pin 12 of the WT32-ETH01.
GND: Connect GND to the breakout board’s ground rail.

## UART Connections:

Connect RX0 from the programmer to TX0 on the WT32-ETH01.

Connect TX0 from the programmer to RX0 on the WT32-ETH01.

## Extra Ground Pin:
Connect GND from the breakout board to pin 11 on the WT32-ETH01.

## Boot Mode Jumper:
Use a jumper wire to connect pin 24 (IO0) to pin 23 (GND).

## Enter Programming Mode
Briefly touch a jumper wire between the common GND and pin 1 (EN) to reset the module.

Remove the jumper wire between pin 24 (IO0) and pin 23 (GND).

Your WT32-ETH01 is now in programming mode and ready for flashing firmware.

## Return to Normal Operation
To return the WT32-ETH01 to normal operation mode, simply:

Touch pin 1 (EN) with ground again to reset the module.
